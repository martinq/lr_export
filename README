= lr_export: Bookshare/Learning Registry submitter =
====================================================

Pulls book information from Bookshare's repository and
publishes metadata in NSDL Dublin Core format to a
Learning Registry node.

lr_export will look at the log file directory to
determine when the program was last run, and will
query Bookshare for books in the "Textbooks" and
"Educational Materials" categories that have been
added to the repository since that date.

If no log files are found, as is the case when the
program is first run, lr_export will use a start
date of 1/1/2002, which predates the creation of the
Bookshare repository.

The completed list of books is then submitted to the
specified Learning Registry node.
